# Typing-practice-program [Console]

This program has the following features that allow users to interact within the console:
### [ Load , Print, Insert, Replace, Restore, Delete, Exercise, Exit ]
- "Load": When this command is entered, a message asking the user to enter a file name is displayed in the console. The user can then load the content of the file into the program. This feature allows users to easily import desired data.

- "Print": Executing this command will display all the words of the inputted or loaded data in the console. This allows users to have an overview of the entire content of the data.

- "Insert": When this command is entered, a message asking the user to enter a new word is displayed. The word entered by the user is then added to the end of the existing data. This allows users to expand the data as needed.

- "Replace": Executing this command prompts the user to enter the word to be found and the word to replace it with. The program then searches for all occurrences of the word in the stored data and replaces them with the specified replacement word. This feature enables users to easily modify specific parts of the data.

- If no word is entered within the data, i.e., if a blank or empty string is entered, a message saying "Invalid word" is displayed. This immediately alerts the user to the input error and allows for prompt correction.

- "Restore": This command provides the functionality to restore modified data back to its original state. This allows users to revert to the original data if any accidental changes occur.

- "Delete": When this command is entered, a message asking the user to enter a word is displayed. All occurrences of the word entered by the user are then deleted from the data. This feature provides users with the ability to remove specific words from the data.

- "Exercise": Upon entering this command, a message asking the user to enter the number of words and the maximum width is displayed. Each word is then printed on a separate line, with the position of the words being randomly determined. Additionally, this command allows users to engage in word practice. When the user enters a correct word, the corresponding word is deleted, and the number of words entered is displayed. The exercise ends when the user has entered all the words.

- "Exit": This command allows for the termination of the program. It enables users to safely exit the program when needed.

- If the user enters an incorrect command, the console displays the message "Wrong command". This immediately alerts the user to the input error.

I hope the above translation adequately captures the features of the program. If you have any further questions or need clarification on any of the features, please let me know.
